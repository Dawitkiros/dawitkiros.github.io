I am currently a PhD researcher at Signal processing group at [NTNU](https://www.ntnu.no/) with Prof. [Stefan Werner](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/stefan.werner), where I focus on pushing the boundaries of federated learning (FL) through privacy-preserving machine learning and distributed optimization. My current work explores innovative strategies for enhancing privacy in FL, making it feasible for low-resource devices, and addressing challenges posed by data heterogeneity. I am always open to new collaborations—feel free to reach out if our research interests align!
